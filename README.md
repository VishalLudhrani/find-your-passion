Project built with `create-react-app`

<br />

# The WHY behind this project
I watched [The Futur's "Turn Passion Into Profit - Ikigai Workshop" on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAzs3amtEFA), and I looked for online tools that could imitate the activities performed in that workshop. I couldn't find the exact one to imitate the activities as is (I loved the activities, so I want them as is), so I decided to create a tool myself!
